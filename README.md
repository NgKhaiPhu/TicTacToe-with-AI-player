# TicTacToe with AI player
This is my submission for lab assignment 2 of "Introduction to AI" class. This repository contains a perfect TicTacToe player that uses minimax alpha-beta pruning algorithm to make the optimal move every turn. A heuristic evaluation function is implemented in order to shorten up computational time.

## Features
- An undefeatable Tictactoe player that will always win or tie the game
- A simple, clickable TicTacToe board built with pygame
- 2 game modes: 3x3 and 5x5

## Usage
Simply run the main script and follow the prompts to make your moves.

## Requirements
- pygame
- numpy
